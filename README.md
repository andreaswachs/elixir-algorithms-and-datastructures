# Elixir Algorithms and Data Structures

This is a toy project of mine. My plan is to implement various algorithms and data structures to become up my skills as an elixir developer.

I hope to learn a lot about the Elixir programming language and over time be better at writing idiomatic Elixir code.

## Installation

The package can be installed in your project by adding `eads` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:eads, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
